# My practice - Coursera.org DeepLearning.AI Specialization  

### Date: June 2020, currently reviewing CNN class with a local Meetup.  
### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

### Environment and Setup  
In June 2020, moved local repo to Ubuntu side.  
PATH: ~/work/deep-learning/dlai/  
Conda environment dlpy on Ubuntu side.  
   Use with VS Code and Jupyter Notebook; Python v 3.8. -- no. 
   Memo: tensorflow 2.0 not compatible with Python v 3.8, use with Python v 3.7 isntead.

### Class 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
  * June 9, 2020 - rewatching Youtube videos, at 9/11 in playlist.  
    At July Meetup, large group will start week 1 of class 3.  

### Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks 
Coursera.org, DeepLearning.AI Specialization  

  * June 1, 2020 -- started reviewing notebook for week1, Step-by-Step.  
    Total pain in the ass matching up dimensions using numpy.   
    Do later, maybe with a glass of wine. :-)  
    Use solutions for now, with Meetup call tonight.  
    Watch videos and start on 2nd notebook, tensorflow introduction.  
    
  * June 9 to do: Class 4 has notebook 10, readme txt file, github changes not copied to this rep, still in learn-mldl repo.  
  * Maybe don't try to reproduce the whole thing, but start one class at a time, new version?  

### Class 5: Sequence Models  
Speech recognition, text analysis, sentiment analysis, temporal image/sound/text analysis.  

  * May 2020 - started watching videos and looking at notebooks.  
  * Chollet book also has a chapter on sequence models.  

### Folder "source" has all downloaded notebook solutions and important papers.  
  * Solutions are as of April 2019. 
  * Papers -- StyleTransfer, DeepFace...
