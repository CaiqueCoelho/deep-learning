# My practice - Coursera.org DeepLearning.AI Specialization  

### Date: Sept 2020 update.  All notebooks and quizzes behind a paywall now, and audit option is closed.  
Will download all notebooks, and move on to 
***fast.ai version 2, Practical Deep Learning for Coders***  

### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

### Environment and Setup   
I use conda environment **dlpy from Ubuntu (WSL) side**.   
Local storage moved in July 2020 to C: directory.  
PATH: c:/python/repos/deep-learning/

### Class 1: Neural Networks  
  * Finished in Fall 2019.  
  
### Class 2: Hyperparameters tuning  
  * Finished in Fall 2019.  

### Class 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
  * Finished in Jan 2020.

### Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks 
  Downloaded tar files to local computer, all notebooks work.  
  Manually copied image folder, and other sub folders to Github.  
  Data files for some weeks too large > 100MB, did not push to Github  
  (Instead in local c:\.~dlai-large-file folder.)
    \-  
  * Small group 9/15 TU - Dan, Peter, Me 
    To do YOLO notebook.  
    Downloaded everything. Sunday - should be able to finish.  
    
  * Next meetup, 10/13/2020 TU 
    New people will present "step-by-Step" notebook  
    Back-prop is optional (2 sections) the more interesting parts. 

### Class 5: Sequence Models  
    Speech recognition, text analysis, sentiment analysis, temporal image/sound/text analysis.  

  * May 2020 - started watching videos and looking at notebooks.  
  * Chollet book also has a chapter on sequence models.  

### Folder "source" has all downloaded notebook solutions and important papers.  
  * Solutions are as of April 2019. 
  * Papers -- StyleTransfer, DeepFace...
