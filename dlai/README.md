### Date: Sept 30, 2020 update.  
All notebooks and quizzes behind a paywall now, and audit option is closed.  

 * Nov & Dec 2020 Meetups were from ***fast.ai 2020 classes***   
***fast.ai version 2, March 2020 class, Practical Deep Learning for Coders***

### Class 1: Neural Networks  
  * Finished in Fall 2019.  
  
### Class 2: Hyperparameters tuning  
  * Finished in Fall 2019.  

### Class 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
  * Finished in Jan 2020.

### Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks 
  Downloaded tar files to local computer, all notebooks work.  
  Manually copied image folder, and other sub folders to Github.  
  Data files for some weeks too large > 100MB, did not push to Github  
  (Instead in local c:\.~dlai-large-file folder.)
    \-  
  * Oct 6th Tuesday 7pm,  small group.
  * Watched all videos on Art Style.  Next, run notebook, don't put too much time.  
  * Read paper on Art Style, YOLO Tutorial, Paper.  
    *   Here's the style transfer paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf
    *   Here's the original yolo paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf
    *   YOLO tutorial: https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/real-time-object-detection-with-yolo-yolov2-28b1b93e2088#:~:text=YOLO%20uses%20sum%2Dsquared%20error,The%20loss%20function%20composes%20of%3A&text=the%20localization%20loss%20(errors%20between,the%20objectness%20of%20the%20box)

  * Next meetup, 10/13/2020 TU 
    New people will present "step-by-Step" notebook  
    Back-prop is optional (2 sections) the more interesting parts.

### Class 5: Sequence Models  
  * Speech recognition, text analysis, sentiment analysis, temporal image/sound/text analysis.  
  * Chollet book also has a chapter on sequence models.  

### Folder "source" has all downloaded notebook solutions and important papers.  
  * Solutions are as of April 2019. 
  * Papers -- StyleTransfer, DeepFace...
