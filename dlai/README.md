# My practice - Coursera.org DeepLearning.AI Specialization  

### Date: June 2020, currently reviewing CNN class with a local Meetup.  
### Author: Jennifer E Yoon  

### Environment and Setup   
I use conda environment **dlpy from Ubuntu (WSL) side**.   
Local storage moved in July 2020 to C: directory.  
PATH: c:/python/repos/deep-learning/  

---  

### Class 1: Neural Networks  
  * Finished in Fall 2019.  
  * Week 3, 4 has detailed math for forward and backward pass, stochastic gradient descent, intergration of popular activation functions. 
  
### Class 2: Hyperparameters tuning  
  * Finished in Fall 2019.  
  * Reviewed with Meetup main group.  

### Class 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
  * Finished in Jan 2020.
  * June 9, 2020 - rewatching Youtube videos, at 9/11 in playlist.  
  * Meetup main group, on week 2, September meeting.  

### Class 4: Convolutional Neural Networks 
  * WIP, August 2020  
  * Meetup small group, finished ResNet notebook in July.  
  * August -- will discuss YOLO notebook, maybe revew backprop.  
    \-
  * June 1, 2020 -- started reviewing notebook for week1, Step-by-Step.  
    matching up dimensions using numpy - requires patience.   
  * June 9 to do: Class 4 has notebook 10, readme txt file, github changes not copied to this rep, still in learn-mldl repo.   

### Class 5: Sequence Models  
    Speech recognition, text analysis, sentiment analysis, temporal image/sound/text analysis.  

  * May 2020 - started watching videos and looking at notebooks.  
  * Chollet book also has a chapter on sequence models.  

### Folder "source" has all downloaded notebook solutions and important papers.  
  * Solutions are as of April 2019. 
  * Papers -- StyleTransfer, DeepFace...
