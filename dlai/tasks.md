 ### Monday June 1, 2020 small group meetup.  
 Went over Quiz for week1 together.
 Dan & Peter, watched all videos and only begun to do notebooks.  
 Me did most of step-by-step, but was very fiddly.  
 2nd notebook uses Tensorflow v 1.2, can try with tensorflow v2.2 instead.  
 Dan & Peter will present class2 hyperparameters tuning, optimization notebooks (weeks 2 and 3) at large group meetupon next tuesday.  
 
 ### Next small group meetup, July 13, 2020 Monday.  
 1 day before general meetup and after SciPy virtual conference.  
 Class 4 CNN, week2 focus, optional review of week1 notebooks.
 
 **Update: 7/11/2020 Saturday:**  
 Monday, small group: 
   * Dan - Class 4, week 2, notebook 1
   * Peter -- checking on his noteboooks, interested in my talk SciPy, either session.
 
 Tuesday, main group:  
   * Dan, Class 2 week 3, TF v1 tutorial notebook, all 3 of use will try.  
   * Peter -- will be there
 
 ### Update 7/13/2020 - for August
