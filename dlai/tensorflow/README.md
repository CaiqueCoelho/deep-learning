**TensorFlow** is a **Python** and **C++** API library for running deep learning models.  It comes with **NumPy** for **Python v3+** users.  Requires the use of a package manager for installation, such as Docker (recommended by Nishant Shukla) or Conda (Anaconda or Miniconda).

Under the hood, packages are written in C++.  Would be helpful to have some familiarity with C++ in order to read TensorFlow source code.
