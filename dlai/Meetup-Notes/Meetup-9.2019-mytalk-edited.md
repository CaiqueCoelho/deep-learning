### Coursera DeepLearning.AI Classes  

 * Transfer learning – a major part of modern usage pattern.   

   - Class 3, Week 2, Lesson 7.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yofjFQddwHE  
   - Class 4, Week 2, Lesson 4.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYth6EbBUqM)  

 * Data augmentation – another major part of modern usage.  (Can’t remember which video)  

### Fast.AI Classes   

Fast.AI wants to democratize deep learning.  They start off right from the beginning with transfer learning and data augmentation.  These are two most important parts of modern deep learning practice.  They believe in a top-down teaching method.  Students can build useful models within a few weeks.  They provide a custom python package called "fastai".  This makes the user interface easier for students.  The 2018 classes use fastai version 0.7, and 2019 classes use fastai version 1.0.  If you are replicating these classes, be very careful which version of "fastai" software you are running.  I use Google CoLab to run fastai.  They have a saved machine with basic software already installed.  You can follow the detailed instructions on CoLab getting started from fast.ai's class page.  

 * Talk about fast.ai 2018 version lesson 1 - transfer learning.    
   - Lesson 1 video (http://course18.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html)  
   - Lesson 1 wiki (https://forums.fast.ai/t/wiki-lesson-1/9398)  

    * Top Sobel filter - Convolution filter matrix calculation demo.  
      From the drop-box in the middle of the web page, select "Top Sobel" filter.

    * Fastai - Excel convolution demo - part of lecture 1 video, towards the end.    

 * Talk about fast.ai lesson 2 - data augmentation.

### Numpy Tutorial  

 * DLAI has a short numpy tutorial (https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/dlai/dlai-class1/week2/Python%2BBasics%2BWith%2BNumpy%2Bv3.ipynb)  

 * Stanford CS231n has a longer, decent numpy tutorial (https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/CS231n/cs231n-PythonNumpyTutorial/python-numpy-tutorial.md)  

 * [VanderPlas book](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) has the best Numpy tutorial.
   - Has KNN example with 10 data points in 2D.  
   - Shows how to use argsort and fancy indexing.  
   - Useful for Stanford CS231n class - Homework 1, part 1, KNN.  
   - After doing the KNN example with 10 data points, you can try doing it with CIFAR10 image dataset.  
   - VanderPlas does NOT cover basic Python. Use other sources.  

### Learning Python, standard library  

 * [Python Crash Course book](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/)  
   - Easy for basic Python.  Do first several chapters.  

   - Follow along on the book, cover the code with paper, then type them into your Jupyter notebook. DO NOT copy and paste.  You will notice a lot of syntax errors.  You won't learn the syntax correctly unless you manually type the code yourself, and make all those errors, and practice spotting and correcting them. :-)    

 * Stanford CS228 also has a decent Python Standard Library tutorial. (https://github.com/JennEYoon/learn-mldl/blob/master/CS231n/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb)
