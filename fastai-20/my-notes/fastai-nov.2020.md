# Fastai Class my notes, 

#### Nov 26, 2020  

  * Installed fastai on my laptop. Ubuntu version.  
    - Created new conda env.  Python version 3.6  
    - Exported conda env, compared with posted on fastai github. More extensive.  
    - Install -c fastai fastai (includes all other python libraries)  
    
  * Video Lesson 3 - covers fastbook nb2, but goes into more depth.  
    - To see parameters of fastai functions, move pointer to inside ( ) sift+click. 
      Dropdown menu with full parameters.  Deomoed for data augmentation settings.  
    - To examine fastai code, usde "nbs" folder.  Easier to view, full documentation.  
      Ex vision:  fastai/nbs/07_vision.core.ipynb   
      https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/nbs/07_vision.core.ipynb  
    - #hide, :s, :note -- commands for producing printed book.  
    - In Data Cleanup step, interactive combo-box selection -- produced with "nbdev". It's a Jupyter Widget.  
    
  * Later - Ubuntu workspace remove:  
    * Fastai folders, except keep 1.  Maybe on C:/python side.  Update from Github.  
    * Coursera CL4 downlaods, delete all except 1. Already on Github.  Large datafiles, keep in C drive, not upload to Github. 
      Keep Google Drive link share for large data files, pre-built model files.
