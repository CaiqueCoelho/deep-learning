Cat example:  Upload button, show uploaded image, seems to work but not sure.  
learn.save() worked!  Saved to mounted gdrive. downloaded to local computer.  

Logged out of Colab by mistake, but was saved to my mounted GDrive anyway!  How?  
Control-Save was hit several times.  

Segmentation -- not very accurate.  

IMDB - need to use batchsize=32.  Colab runs out of memory after 30 minutes or so.  
Not able to test prediction, movie sentiment.
